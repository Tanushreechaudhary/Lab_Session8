# Education at Santa Clara University is far from typical!
Lab Session 8 is a redesign of lab session 5, where we designed a factsheet on Santa Clara's MSIS program.
Here is the link to lab session 5:

## Lab 5 Visualization:
![lab5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32647064-6a0f629e-c5a4-11e7-97ea-76d14541ec52.png)
## Critique for the Visualization:
The Visualization provides three different metrics about Salary, Graduation rate and GPA. In the graph about GPA, showing average GPA using circles was not a good idea. As we can see, there is hardly any difference between the top 2 circles. For the other two graphs as well, I will be using some different and more effective charts that will help students to actually perceive the information through the visualization rather than labeling the data.

## Roadmap for Improvement:
In the redesign, I will make my claim more strong by adding more metrics, more data that shows the number of students working at top companies and the Unemployment ratio. By knowing about the companies where Alumni are working, gives the prospective students an insight that top companies are willing to hire SCU graduates. And also, they can network with them for future references. Unemployment rate for a particular major tells students that what is the average unemployed students in that major and if the rate is less that means more job safety. This helps them decide upon the major they should opt for!

## Audience:
The audience for the visualization would be "The Prospective students". While selecting a university for graduate studies, students evaluate many options and then select the most suitable fit. The following metrics would help them to see why doing Masters at Santa Clara University is a good choice from the perspective of Compensation, job opportunities, Graduation rate and much more. 

### Audience Need: 
When considering a university, the most important metrics to look out for are post-graduation Salary, GPA breakdown, where are the Alumni working, the Graduation rate and the if the university they are considering have majors will low unemployment rate or not. 

### Audience Want: 
Students want a university which has a curriculum that can help them get good salaries after graduation. Every student strives for good GPA, and wants to Graduate on time. Nowadays, students are very concerned about knowing the companies where the Alumni are working, this can help them get a reference and also during the Alumni meets current students can know from them how to get into good companies. The Employment ratio as per the major helps them to decide on what major they should opt for. 

### Audience Fears:
1. Unable to get a decent-paying job
2. Not able to maintain a good GPA
3. Fear of being unemployed after the graduation
4. Unable to finish the course on time

                                                 ## Redesign: The key metrics are:

### 1. SCU MIS graduates earn $8100 more than USF graduates!
![mis_salary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32646969-f4f539c0-c5a3-11e7-8a66-9f4d354ed331.png)
The visualization shows that MSIS graduates from Santa Clara University are paid higher starting Salaries in comparison to University of San Francisco and San Jose State University. One important reason behind this could be the curriculum designed for the students. At SCU, coursework is project-based, connecting learning to actual challenges in the field. The other important reason would be the location. SCU is ideally positioned at the heart of the valley, which gives MSIS students exposure to leading edge technology and potential employers.

### 2. SCU students are very particular about the deadlines, even if its the course!
![graduationrate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32646968-f4d2abda-c5a3-11e7-858e-c6cabeb80827.png)
The visualization shows a donut chart that compares students graduating from three universities and clearly, students at SCU graduate in more timely manner. Graduation Rate tells about the time in which a student enters and completes a degree. So, for SCU, 77%(out of 100) enrolled students complete their degrees in 4 years. While this percentage is very low for San Jose State University.
This Graduation Rate acts as a measure for accountability and transparency. Low GR can imply that students are not getting the academic support they need to succeed, that they are disappointed by the faculty or staff, or that they find life at the school unaffordable. 
And that may give a red flag to a prospective student because extended enrollment is costly, so its best to finish the course on time.

### 3. Great Academic support, at SCU 43% students have GPA 3.75 or higher!
![gpa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32646967-f4af37e0-c5a3-11e7-832d-1a21e9a5e073.png)
In choosing a university to attend, it is important to find a good fit â€“ a place that provides a challenging academic environment. The visualization provides us the information about what is the percentage of students that fall under a particular GPA Range. The size is decreasing and the color is fading as per the percentage. We can clearly see that 43% of students at SCU have GPA 3.75 or Higher, while at SJSU and University of San Francisco this percentage is 20% and 40% respectively. 
The GPA Breakdown statistics shows that at SCU, there is a competitive environment which motivates students to perform well and shine! 

### 4. An immense network of professional contacts at SCU!
![alumni](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32646965-f489d540-c5a3-11e7-944c-6c0afc1e602f.png)
At every university, alumni profile is an important factor to look at for evaluating the market value of the university. The visualization here shows that top companies like Apple, Google, Oracle, Cisco etc are hiring SCU Alumni. The prospective students can know what can they expect when they graduate and also it provides them with great networking opportunities. Students can connect with them over professional websites and build relationshps over the long-term.

### 5. Choosing MSIS pretty much guarantees you a job!
![unemp rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32077698/32689037-d4275906-c690-11e7-9cdc-daf561642424.png)
The Visualization here shows the unemployment rate as per the majors. As we can see, MSIS has 0.05824 unemployment rate, which is very less as compared to other majors. The prospective students can take a note that taking this course, also ensures job security along with a good salary. Solid analytical skills and comprehensive business knowledge developed at SCU gives you an edge in the industry and job security too!
