## Audience:
The audience for the visualization would be "The Prospective students". While selecting a university for graduate studies, students evaluate many options and then select the most suitable fit. The following metrics would help them to see why doing Masters at Santa Clara University is a good choice from the perspective of Compensation, job opportunities, Graduation rate and much more. 

### Audience Need: 
When considering a university, the most important metrics to look out for are post-graduation Salary, GPA breakdown, where are the Alumni working, the Graduation rate and the Employment ratio. 

### Audience Want: 
Students want a university which has a curriculum that can help them get good salaries after graduation. Every student strives for good GPA, and wants to Graduate on time. Nowadays, students are very concerned about knowing the companies where the Alumni are working, this can help them get a reference and also during the Alumni meets current students can know from them how to get into good companies. The Employment ratio as per the major helps them to decide on what major they should opt for.

## Key Metrics:
### 1. Average Salaries earned by MSIS graduates:
According to 21st College Salary Report, MSIS graduates from Santa Clara University are paid higher starting Salaries in comparison to University of San Francisco and San Jose State University. One important reason behind this could be the curriculum designed for the students. At SCU, coursework is project-based, connecting learning to actual challenges in the field. The other important reason would be the location. SCU is ideally positioned at the heart of the valley, which gives MSIS students exposure to leading edge technology and potential employers.
